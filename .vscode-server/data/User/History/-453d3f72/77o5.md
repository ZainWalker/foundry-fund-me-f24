#### Notes

- Anvil: To deploy a local blockchain - like Ganache, which is deprecated
- Forge: compiling and interacting with our contracts
- Cast: Interacting with contracts that have already been deployed
- Can take an RPC URL from a node as a service such as Alchemy and use it to send transactions from our Foundry
